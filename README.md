# SSH Tab Completion

Source the ssh_tools.sh file to have ssh tab-completion setup.
Based off of defined hosts in the `~/.ssh/config` file!
This also has a ssh_ip function that, when called with a single argument, will attempt to retrieve the IP address for the specified host from the `~/.ssh/config` file!
